    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote before about safety and how I don&rsquo;t want a safety on my guns.  That is because a safety is a delusion.  A
drawn weapon is not safe, so don&rsquo;t try to make it safer.  That is the dull-knife mentality.  I understand if you must
carry a loaded gun, a mechanical safety might be useful.  Better would be a grip lock that recognized your hand.  And I can come
up with better than that too because I am ridiculously creative nowadays.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t have to carry a loaded gun, so I can simply &lsquo;lock it away&rsquo;.  Hence no safety.  Must undo locks and after
that, clearly I intend to use the nasty thing or I would relock it.</p>

<h2>Ultimate Lock</h2>

<p>The ultimate lock is the thing simply does not exist&hellip; or at least not to you.  My F-14 is very safely locked away.
As are all my ICBMs.  Nuclear subs.  Etc.</p>

<h2>Multiple Locks</h2>

<p>Even with the ultimate lock, it is useful to have multiple locks on things.  This isn&rsquo;t redundancy: you can&rsquo;t get in
with just one of the two locks&hellip; you must get <em>both</em> of them.</p>

<p>For example, my F-14 has multiple locks.  If you park it in front of my house, ready for me to jump in, it is unfortunately
still locked despite it&rsquo;s proximity.  It is actually ridiculously locked:</p>

<ul>
<li> It may have no fuel, and I can&rsquo;t tow an F-14 to a fighter-jet-fueling-station!</li>
<li> Even if I could, I don&rsquo;t know where a FJFS is!</li>
<li> Even if I could, I don&rsquo;t think they would let me fuel it (being a civilian and all)!</li>
<li> Even if I could, I don&rsquo;t think Moffet would let me pull it to their runway (civilian again) and Palo Alto might be too short!</li>
<li> EIIC: I don&rsquo;t have a helmet&hellip; but maybe you left that in there&hellip;</li>
<li> EIIC: I don&rsquo;t actually know how to fly an F-14.  So I better get a video game or mage to teach me.</li>
</ul>


<p>So my F-14 has at least seven locks on it.  Very unlikely I am going to accidentally get access to it.  Which suits me
fine: I don&rsquo;t think I will need my F-14 any time soon.  And if I do (Zombies and all), I think I can survive long enough
to undo the seven locks.</p>

<h2>Weapon locks</h2>

<p>Turns out all my weapons are locked pretty similarly to the F-14.  I simply don&rsquo;t own any of them.  So undoing the locks
will take quite a bit of forethought and a significant passage of time.  Much better and safer than a stupid safety :-)</p>

<p>I do carry seven tennis rackets though&hellip;</p>

    <id>http://everzast.com/blog/be-careful-what-you-write-about</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apparently I have the ability to cause we to experience the things I am writing about&hellip;</p>

<p>I was working on checking out Christmas light strands, and it rained in California recently (See <a href="http://SupersonicFox.com/">http://SupersonicFox.com/</a>
for how shocking this is, and somehow there was a short.  Now in most houses this would trip something and you would
just flip a switch, but I live in the <a href="http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/">http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/</a> in a rented house, so my house is not normal.
And it <em>blew out</em> the circuit breaker vs. doing something easily recoverable.</p>

<p>A call to an electrician on a Sunday provided no results, and the circuit that was blown holds several thousand dollars
of meat for <a href="http://FullOfLifeFood.com">http://FullOfLifeFood.com</a>.</p>

<p>So I needed to either run a long extension cord, or get me some electricity.</p>

<p>One of my rules is that I don&rsquo;t buy <em>bad stuff</em>.  I don&rsquo;t work with <em>bad people</em> either (preferring friendly mages or at
least friendly competent people).  I also never <em>cross-buy</em>: Use one person&rsquo;s resources to buy from a different person.
 So I don&rsquo;t use amazon to buy from a store or a store to buy from amazon.  I buy lots of things from Amazon, but however
 fast they deliver&hellip; without the Quad-Copter-Droid system I was not going to get something good from Amazon.</p>

<p>So I went to <a href="http://HomeDepot.com">http://HomeDepot.com</a> and studied the reviews.  I saw a lot of generators, but they all weighed 100+ pounds.
Yes, I can lift 100+ pounds, but try to avoid it.  And I buy things intending that my wife and daughters can use them
if they need to.  Pretty sure Katrina can&rsquo;t lift 100 pounds.</p>

<p>But in amongst these behemoths was a diamond: a Ryobi generator that weighs maybe 40 pounds.  I have Ryobi equipment and
they are very nice.  Best battery system I have.  So a trip to two Home Depots (stores are bad at tracking inventory)
and surviving the nastiest parking lot traffic I have been in recently, and I now have the Ryobi generator.  The
reviews said to use different oil and a different plug, so I bought the oil but didn&rsquo;t know the size of the plug without
opening the box.</p>

<p>Strangely the box and instructions never mentioned the gas size, but a small spill and a non-spill confirm it is a bit
less than a gallon (or my two-gallon gas can is quite a bit more than two gallons).</p>

<p>Very nice generator.  Supposedly quiet.  If that is true, I hope never to need one of the behemoths!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>is more likely to live.</p>

<p>Especially when you are on your own or in small groups, you need to be <em>in motion</em>.  If you are completely still,
you are an easy target or prey.  A zombie could just quietly walk up to you and take a bite.  Doesn&rsquo;t feel good, and
in some Apocs, you are now suddenly on the other side and all this training has gone to waste.</p>

<p>Biting things that are moving around is much harder.</p>

<p>Yes, you could just dance around the room and you have started the first level of being in motion.  But to get to the
real &lsquo;in motion&rsquo;, you should also be trying to achieve something.  Something very valuable.  Because a lot has to get
done after the Apoc, and there are a lot fewer people around&hellip; so if you have a mirror, you might want to look into it
and start there.</p>

<p>The Postman, Mad Max, Divergent, Hunger Games, etc. all teach us that <em>moving around purposefully</em> is far more effective than
either not moving or not having a purpose.  So try it out today so you are ready for tomorrow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People try to raise all kinds of kids.  Clearly many of these parents have strange motives, and the kids come out quite twisted
by these motives.  Personally, I view myself as the smartest person on the planet (by choosing and being chosen
by Rebecca), so I don&rsquo;t have to make my kids prove to me how much smarter than me they are.  They do anyway&hellip;. It makes me
happy mostly&hellip; a little sad at my failings&hellip;</p>

<p>So my kids are smarter than me without being stressed by it?  YES!</p>

<p>So my kids are SEL-er than me without being stressed by it?  YES!</p>

<p>So I can crush them at the gun range without them being stressed by it?  YES!</p>

<p>And at the miniature golf course, they are working themselves up to my level?  YES!</p>

<p>Kids are meant to <em>have fun</em>.  If they aren&rsquo;t <em>having fun</em> then the fault is all on their parents.  On YOU!</p>

<p>Yes, kids have to do chores, go to school, do homework, hang with friends, go to sleep, &hellip; and it is your responsibility
to make all these things be fun.  Or at least &ldquo;easily doable&rdquo;.  Because after the Apoc, kids are going to have to easily
do a lot of nastier things&hellip; so they better be resilient.  And good runners.  Or good tree climbers.  Ideally both!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am trying to learn to wield a Katana: a Japanese sword.  Turns out that buying a Katana is not
very difficult, but learning how to wield a Katana is ridiculously difficult.  I live in an area that
has many insane (aka &lsquo;awesome&rsquo;) people, but I may have to drive significant amount of hours to find Katana Mages.</p>

<p>The drive is worth it, so I don&rsquo;t have a problem with this equation.  Just surprising&hellip;.</p>

    <id>http://everzast.com/blog/safety</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuing further into the jungle&hellip; no safetys!  If I draw a gun, I am about to <em>kill you</em>.  Make your choice, you are opposed
by lethal force.  I drew a gun.  Lethal (life ending in a split of a second) force.   If you wish to live, please move
along.  I <em>do not</em> want to kill you.  But if you do not move along, I will.  Simple choice.   If you look at my shot pattern,
you will recognize that this is not a variable.  I spray within a centimeter.   Yes.  Seriously.   I am a professional
shooter.  I was taught by myself and a professional mage name Rick.  I &ldquo;don&rsquo;t miss&rdquo;.   Kill me or move along.  The third option neither you or I will enjoy.</p>

<h2>It is all about the revolvers!</h2>

<p>So the dynamics of revolvers are very much more interesting than automatics.  If you have a great automatic, you
have a great &lsquo;touch&rsquo; weapon.  Touch it.  People die.  Or targets get nasty holes.  A revolver has two epic choices.
Flow through the trigger, or &lsquo;touch&rsquo; it.  If you do not cock (with your other hand, fool!) the revolver, the flow is
incredibly satisfying.  If you precock the instrument-of-destruction, then things are simpler.  The first feels like
aikido, the second like the god of death.  Interesting alternatives.</p>

    <link href="http://everzast.com/blog/weapon-up/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-04T06:15:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://everzast.com/blog/weapon-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OK, so now we get into the heart of the jungle: after the Apoc, you need to be armed.  Armed with what?  Three things:</p>

<ul>
<li> An ability to defend yourself and your community without a weapon</li>
<li> An ability to defend yourself and your community with a melee weapon</li>
<li> An ability to defend yourself and your community with a ranged weapon</li>
</ul>


<p>And ideally for the weapons, you have a fricken-awesome weapon that can last until the Apoc ends&hellip; which could be
never&hellip; so pick wisely.  And get a sensei or mage to teach you.  And practice.  1000 hours.</p>

<h2>Weapon Cheats</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to learn how to use a weapon, you can cheat but it will take possibly more time and be less fricken-awesome.</p>

<p>For example, I swing a tennis racket like a two-headed axe.  I don&rsquo;t actually own a two-headed axe, but I am pretty sure if
it weighs about the same as my tennis racket, I can swing it.  At 100+ MPH.  Likely effective defense.</p>

<p>You could do the same thing with darts.  Maybe Javelin.  Shot-put.  Maybe bowling although if zombies can jump that won&rsquo;t
be very effective.</p>

    <link href="http://everzast.com/blog/get-me-some-electricity/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-03T06:15:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://everzast.com/blog/get-me-some-electricity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I already wrote how you should shun electricity (<a href="http://everzast.com/blog/shun-electricity/">http://everzast.com/blog/shun-electricity/</a>).  That is true unless you
have your own redundant source of electricity.
The main wires are going to all be down, so you are going to need to get another source.  You could stockpile a lot
of gas or diesel fuel.  But you need to be mobile, so storing and transporting it is going to be a problem.  I recommend
you watch Mad Max <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max</a> to get some ideas about that.  Even if &ldquo;the natives&rdquo; are not
quite so unfriendly, the solution is about the same.  Not sure how many oil rigs will be working, so you might want
to buy and fill the truck now.  You could probably park it in an RV parking lot.  Or on the street, but some people
have issues with that, and some cities laws against it.  I believe those laws are unconstitutional, so you might want to
park now to get the wheels of justice in motion.</p>

<p>A slightly smaller version of the same idea is a Class-A motorhome.  You can find out more about them at <a href="http://butterflybus.org">http://butterflybus.org</a>.
The fuel tank of a Diesel-Pusher can be up to 150 gallons, so you have a pretty good reservoir there.  I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend moving it very
much or you will lose a lot of those gallons (about one per eight miles traveled).  And parking has a similar problem.</p>

<p>An alternative to liquid fuels is solar fuel.  In only a few of the dystopias is the sun blotted from the sky.
In that case, you should have a backup plan, so maybe you need the liquid fuels and a solar solution.  But if you had
to pick, getting a few-thousand-dollar solar solution seems the logical first step.</p>

<p>Amazingly these are already reasonable priced for mobile versions.  So buy two, and start reading up on motorhomes.</p>

    <link href="http://everzast.com/blog/drive-like-jason/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-02T06:15:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://everzast.com/blog/drive-like-jason</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The future will have roads and automobiles.  Blowing up all the roads in the United States would imply that the Earth
is no longer around.  ZAST will not help you if the earth is no longer here.  Some other mage may be able to help you
with that.  Probably a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technomage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technomage</a>, but I have no idea how to find one.</p>

<p>OK, so we have roads and automobiles, we just need gas to make the cars move and drivers to drive them around.
And we don&rsquo;t need just any kind of driver.  Old women from Pasadena won&rsquo;t make the cut.  We need Jason Statham.
We need transporters (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/</a>).</p>

<h2>How to be a transporter</h2>

<p>To be a transporter, you need particular skills and a particular attitude.  The skills you need are demonstrated
by Jason, but I suspect taking a driving course is a better way to learn.  Something like <a href="http://SkipBarber.com">http://SkipBarber.com</a>.
Even better would be a transporter-like simulation and training that included Jason in the car with you.  Not
sure where to get that.</p>

<p>For getting the right attitude you don&rsquo;t need Jason in the car with you.  Watching the transporter will help.
Thinking you are &lsquo;transporting&rsquo; something will also help.  You will notice in the movie that transporters
do not drive particularly quickly.  They drive at normal speed.  The <em>can</em> drive ridiculously quickly, but
they don&rsquo;t.  Normal conditions (pre Apoc, no people trying to kill you), normal behavior.  And by normal,
I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li> At flow speed, or slightly faster (but don&rsquo;t annoy the highway patrol)</li>
<li> Very defensively.  Not slowly (addressed that above) but consider that all cars are trying to kill you.

<ul>
<li>Yes, I know.  This is pre Apoc.  But even pre-Apoc or without any &lsquo;thugs&rsquo; many people <em>can</em> kill you with their cars.  I am pretty sure dieing of manslaughter doesn&rsquo;t feel any different from being murdered</li>
<li>OK, now that all the cars are trying to kill you, what do you do?  Avoid being anywhere near cars!

<ul>
<li>Take roads that have less cars on them.</li>
<li>If you are on a bike, stay on the trails.</li>
<li>If you are with other cars, just keep them at a distance.  Never have a car to your side for longer than needed to pass them.  Obey the three-second rule as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, this may seem totally not-cool.  I never said you would <em>look cool</em>.  I said you would survive the Apoc.
Which is actually <em>cooler</em>?</p>

    <id>http://everzast.com/blog/all-about-the-bass</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is specifically for the human male.  If you are either not-human or not-male, please move along&hellip;. <a href="http://everzast.com/blog/drive-like-jason/">http://everzast.com/blog/drive-like-jason/</a></p>

<p>OK, now that they are gone, I am going to fix you.  Somehow society has broken some of you to thinking that
some women are more physically attractive than other women.  This is a lie.  And if your brain is thinking this, it is
because you have been brain-washed and aren&rsquo;t your right self.</p>

<p>First, go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk&amp;noredirect=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk&amp;noredirect=1</a> and truly listen and watch that movie.</p>

<p>OK, now excepting the guy wandering through the video every once in a while, you can tell if you are &lsquo;broken&rsquo; if
you don&rsquo;t want to please every last one of those women.</p>

<p>OK, so how to fix you?  You can watch this movie over and over.  You can watch a lot of videos.  Watch the women in your neighborhood.
And keep asking why wouldn&rsquo;t I want to please her?</p>

<h3>Monogamy</h3>

<p>Oh, and to make it perfectly clear, you must also be completely monogamous while doing this activity.  If you aren&rsquo;t
monogamous, please fix that.  I am pretty sure your wife, love, companion, girlfriend is monogamous, so what is your
problem?  Oh?  Well then find a local news stand, buy a magazine, and learn how to get relief the good old fashioned
way.  Or there is this thing called the internet.  It can help.  But being monogamous is simply a choice.  A very simple
one.</p>

    <link href="http://everzast.com/blog/five-perils/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-30T06:15:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://everzast.com/blog/five-perils</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a ZAS mage.  A mage is someone that is so skilled with something that it looks like magic.  And it usually requires
about ten thousand hours to become a mage.  I became a software mage by reading and writing software for 40 years, 25 years of which
were full time, and 8 years of which were at startups.  This works out to be:</p>

<ul>
<li> 15 years at maybe 500 hours a year, or 7,500 hours</li>
<li> 17 years at maybe 2000 hours a year, or 34,000 hours</li>
<li> 8 years at maybe 4000 hours a year, or 32,000 hours</li>
</ul>


<p>So I definitely passed the 10,000 hour mark by quite a bit.  I was mostly self-taught but leveraged about 2000 great books and Smalltalk-80 to
get me to where I am today.</p>

<p>I am also a tennis mage (<a href="http://supersonicfox.com/blog/being-a-mage/">http://supersonicfox.com/blog/being-a-mage/</a>) and I leveraged a great mage plus youth playing to make it take me more like 1000 hours.  That is
unusually fast to become a mage.</p>

<p>But I became a ZAS mage even faster.  I don&rsquo;t actually recommend this path to anyone, but through it I became a mage almost instantly.
It was by surviving five perils.</p>

<p>The first four were all pretty major:</p>

<ul>
<li> I was going bankrupt</li>
<li> I got fired</li>
<li> My family got evicted without notice (owner reoccupation)</li>
<li> I gave away almost all my possessions (in case we had to move to a smaller place)</li>
</ul>


<p>after all these things happened, and we had recovered from them (new job, money in bank, new home, acceptance of having no possessions)
my family was hit with a fifth peril worse than all of the above&hellip; combined&hellip;   And I changed: I leveled-up.</p>

<p>So if you want the quick path, it is probably something like the above.  But if you are patient and can put in ten thousand
hours, that is probably the better way.</p>

<p>It takes a good bit of time to get in good shape, and without electricity or running water, I am pretty sure the YMCA
will not be a great place to hang out.  So get in shape now.  Learn to run a couple miles.  Most animals and zombies give
up during the second mile.  Learn to do a pull up.  Then twenty.  Good, now you can climb a tree.</p>

<p>And try to get rid of some of that excess fat.  Yes, I know, fat tastes good, but I don&rsquo;t think you want to literally be
a tasty morsel.</p>

<p>Oh, and pass the word along to anyone you love.  We are trying to keep our community, so the maxim &ldquo;Run faster than someone else&rdquo;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love electricity as much as the next person who stuck two pieces of metal into the wall sockets and arced between them, blowing out the circuit,
and frying the pennies (in my case).  I have an electric phone, rode an electric motorcycle, lust for an electric car, and
am writing this on an electric computer.</p>

<p>Pretty sure no electricity after the Apoc.</p>

<p>Again, sorry about that.</p>

<p>So, if you have a beautiful Tesla, you better figure out how you are going to drag that sucker around town.  Or find a really
nice generator that somehow can recharge that sucker, put generator into the trunk or frunk of the Tesla, and then you
are really mobile.</p>

<p>Electric guitar&hellip; switch to acoustic.</p>

<p>Electric shaver&hellip; grow a beard (fool).</p>

<p>Candles&hellip; gas stove&hellip; pens&hellip; bards&hellip;</p>

<p>I would also say &lsquo;Shun really heavy things&rsquo; like pianos.  My daughters can play the piano, but they also can play the flute
and violin.  Much more portable.  Pianos are good sources of: &lsquo;wood&rsquo;, &lsquo;wires&rsquo;, &lsquo;plastic&rsquo;, &lsquo;planks&rsquo;, &lsquo;metal&rsquo;, &lsquo;coffins&rsquo;, [come on, I know you can do it]</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Next, you have to be creative.  But no cannibalism.</p>

<p>If you see a hammer think: hammer, piece of wood, piece of metal, tiny crutch for a schnauzer, poorly weighted and very
dull throwing axe, [keep going, I know you have it in you]</p>

<p>If you see a neighbor&rsquo;s schnauzer think: food, paper fetcher (useless), pooper (maybe), supplier of poop for a catapult (getting somewhere), [&hellip;]</p>

<p>Yes, being creative and being insane are not particularly distinguishable.  Sorry about that.  Try it out, or move along (Zombie fodder).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Strangely the second most important skill after &ldquo;Freeing Your Mind&rdquo; will be redundancy.</p>

<p>Redundancy is the art of having a &ldquo;live&rdquo; equivalent or &ldquo;hot&rdquo; spare to basically everything.
If you have this, and one item fails (Zombie Alert Warning System: ZAWS), then the backup item (ZAW2) is <em>incredibly</em>
unlikely to fail at exactly the same time.   If ZAWS1 and ZAWS2 fail at <em>exactly</em> the same time, then you did not
have a real ZAWS at all, and we will deal with avoiding that problem later (you do know what QA is right?).</p>

<p>Redundancy is incredibly valuable in all things.  Except in marriage.  Monogamy is clearly superior.  But even then you
should have a Hot Spare readily available.  Because you never know do you?  Zombies and all!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The number one skill you must have after the Apoc is to &ldquo;Free Your Mind&rdquo;.  You can not have any negative assumptions about
almost anything.  Again, please trust me.  Amazon Asian Woman!  Might be useful.  Effervescent Ebony Girls!  Might be useful.
Both are amazingly hot, and likely the sources for Apoc Gen2.  If you can&rsquo;t see that, please get your glasses, your cojones,
or whatever does the looking for your body, cleaned and lubed.  Today I hugged #1 and #2 and the ethnicity of neither
affected the hardness of my whatever.</p>

<p>Do the sames girls, but it is hard for me to understand what your hotness sees in a balding wizard like me.  Guest lectures
are quite welcome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been working on building up various skills, but wasn&rsquo;t really quite sure &lsquo;why?&rsquo;.  They started forming a pattern
though, and just a few days ago I came up with the title: &ldquo;Zombie Apocalypse Training (or ZAT)&rdquo; and formally used
that when I invited someone to join me for handgun training.</p>

<p>I changed that to &lsquo;ZAP&rsquo; (Preparation) because that is more fun, but ultimately I had to get a URL.  Somehow I realized
&lsquo;training&rsquo; by itself didn&rsquo;t make much sense: I am training to cause the Apoc?  No, I want my community to survive after
the Apoc, so now I was up to &lsquo;ZAST&rsquo;.  That URL was for sale, but I didn&rsquo;t know the price and it was likely a few hundred dollars.</p>

<p>One more shift and voila: EverZast&hellip; ZAST to last forever after the Apoc.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
