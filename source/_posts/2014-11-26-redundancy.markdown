Strangely the second most important skill after "Freeing Your Mind" will be redundancy.

Redundancy is the art of having a "live" equivalent or "hot" spare to basically everything.
If you have this, and one item fails (Zombie Alert Warning System: ZAWS), then the backup item (ZAW2) is _incredibly_
unlikely to fail at exactly the same time.   If ZAWS1 and ZAWS2 fail at _exactly_ the same time, then you did not
have a real ZAWS at all, and we will deal with avoiding that problem later (you do know what QA is right?).

Redundancy is incredibly valuable in all things.  Except in marriage.  Monogamy is clearly superior.  But even then you
should have a Hot Spare readily available.  Because you never know do you?  Zombies and all!
