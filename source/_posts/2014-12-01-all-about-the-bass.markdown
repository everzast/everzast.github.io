This post is specifically for the human male.  If you are either not-human or not-male, please move along.... <http://everzast.com/blog/drive-like-jason/>

OK, now that they are gone, I am going to fix you.  Somehow society has broken some of you to thinking that
some women are more physically attractive than other women.  This is a lie.  And if your brain is thinking this, it is
because you have been brain-washed and aren't your right self.

First, go watch <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk&noredirect=1> and truly listen and watch that movie.

OK, now excepting the guy wandering through the video every once in a while, you can tell if you are 'broken' if
you don't want to please every last one of those women.

OK, so how to fix you?  You can watch this movie over and over.  You can watch a lot of videos.  Watch the women in your neighborhood.
And keep asking why wouldn't I want to please her?

### Monogamy

Oh, and to make it perfectly clear, you must also be completely monogamous while doing this activity.  If you aren't
monogamous, please fix that.  I am pretty sure your wife, love, companion, girlfriend is monogamous, so what is your
problem?  Oh?  Well then find a local news stand, buy a magazine, and learn how to get relief the good old fashioned
way.  Or there is this thing called the internet.  It can help.  But being monogamous is simply a choice.  A very simple
one.
