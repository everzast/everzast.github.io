Next, you have to be creative.  But no cannibalism.

If you see a hammer think: hammer, piece of wood, piece of metal, tiny crutch for a schnauzer, poorly weighted and very
dull throwing axe, [keep going, I know you have it in you]

If you see a neighbor's schnauzer think: food, paper fetcher (useless), pooper (maybe), supplier of poop for a catapult (getting somewhere), [...]

Yes, being creative and being insane are not particularly distinguishable.  Sorry about that.  Try it out, or move along (Zombie fodder).
