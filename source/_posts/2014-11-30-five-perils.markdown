I am a ZAS mage.  A mage is someone that is so skilled with something that it looks like magic.  And it usually requires
about ten thousand hours to become a mage.  I became a software mage by reading and writing software for 40 years, 25 years of which
were full time, and 8 years of which were at startups.  This works out to be:

   * 15 years at maybe 500 hours a year, or 7,500 hours
   * 17 years at maybe 2000 hours a year, or 34,000 hours
   * 8 years at maybe 4000 hours a year, or 32,000 hours

So I definitely passed the 10,000 hour mark by quite a bit.  I was mostly self-taught but leveraged about 2000 great books and Smalltalk-80 to
get me to where I am today.

I am also a tennis mage (<http://supersonicfox.com/blog/being-a-mage/>) and I leveraged a great mage plus youth playing to make it take me more like 1000 hours.  That is
unusually fast to become a mage.

But I became a ZAS mage even faster.  I don't actually recommend this path to anyone, but through it I became a mage almost instantly.
It was by surviving five perils.

The first four were all pretty major:

   * I was going bankrupt
   * I got fired
   * My family got evicted without notice (owner reoccupation)
   * I gave away almost all my possessions (in case we had to move to a smaller place)

after all these things happened, and we had recovered from them (new job, money in bank, new home, acceptance of having no possessions)
my family was hit with a fifth peril worse than all of the above... combined...   And I changed: I leveled-up.

So if you want the quick path, it is probably something like the above.  But if you are patient and can put in ten thousand
hours, that is probably the better way.
