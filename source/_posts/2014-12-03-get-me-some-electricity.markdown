I already wrote how you should shun electricity.  That is true unless you have your own redundant source of electricity.
The main wires are going to all be down, so you are going to need to get another source.  You could stockpile a lot
of gas or diesel fuel.  But you need to be mobile, so storing and transporting it is going to be a problem.  I recommend
you watch Mad Max <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max> to get some ideas about that.  Even if "the natives" are not
quite so unfriendly, the solution is about the same.  Not sure how many fuel pumps will be working, so you might want
to buy and fill the truck now.  You could probably park it in an RV parking lot.  Or on the street, but some people
have issues with that, and some cities laws against it.

A slightly smaller version of the same idea is a Class-A motorhome.  You can find out more about them at <http://butterflybus.org>.
The fuel tank of a DP can be up to 150 gallons, so you have a pretty good reservoir there.  I wouldn't recommend moving it very
much or you will lose a lot of those gallons (about one per eight miles traveled).  And parking has a similar problem.

An alternative to liquid fuels is simply solar fuel.  In only a few of the dystopias is the sun blotted from the sky.
In that case, you should have a backup plan, so maybe you need the liquid fuels and a solar solution.  But if you had
to pick, getting a few-thousand-dollar solar solution seems the logical first step.

Amazingly these are already reasonable priced for mobile versions.  So buy two, and start reading up on motorhomes.
