The future will have roads and automobiles.  Blowing up all the roads in the United States would imply that the Earth
is no longer around.  ZAST will not help you if the earth is no longer here.  Some other mage may be able to help you
with that.  Probably a <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technomage>, but I have no idea how to find one.

OK, so we have roads and automobiles, we just need gas to make the cars move and drivers to drive them around.
And we don't need just any kind of driver.  Old women from Pasadena won't make the cut.  We need Jason Statham.
We need transporters (<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/>).

## How to be a transporter

To be a transporter, you need particular skills and a particular attitude.  The skills you need are demonstrated
by Jason, but I suspect taking a driving course is a better way to learn.  Something like <http://SkipBarber.com>.
Even better would be a transporter-like simulation and training that included Jason in the car with you.  Not
sure where to get that.

For getting the right attitude you don't need Jason in the car with you.  Watching the transporter will help.
Thinking you are 'transporting' something will also help.  You will notice in the movie that transporters
do not drive particularly quickly.  They drive at normal speed.  The _can_ drive ridiculously quickly, but
they don't.  Normal conditions (pre Apoc, no people trying to kill you), normal behavior.  And by normal,
I mean:

   * At flow speed, or slightly faster (but don't annoy the highway patrol)
   * Very defensively.  Not slowly (addressed that above) but consider that all cars are trying to kill you.
      * Yes, I know.  This is pre Apoc.  But even pre-Apoc or without any 'thugs' many people _can_ kill you with their cars.  I am pretty sure dieing of manslaughter doesn't feel any different from being murdered
      * OK, now that all the cars are trying to kill you, what do you do?  Avoid being anywhere near cars!
         * Take roads that have less cars on them.
         * If you are on a bike, stay on the trails.
         * If you are with other cars, just keep them at a distance.  Never have a car to your side for longer than needed to pass them.  Obey the three-second rule as much as possible.

Yes, this may seem totally not-cool.  I never said you would _look cool_.  I said you would survive the Apoc.
Which is actually _cooler_?
