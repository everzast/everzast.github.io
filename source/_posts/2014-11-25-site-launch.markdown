I have been working on building up various skills, but wasn't really quite sure 'why?'.  They started forming a pattern
though, and just a few days ago I came up with the title: "Zombie Apocalypse Training (or ZAT)" and formally used
that when I invited someone to join me for handgun training.

I changed that to 'ZAP' (Preparation) because that is more fun, but ultimately I had to get a URL.  Somehow I realized
'training' by itself didn't make much sense: I am training to cause the Apoc?  No, I want my community to survive after
the Apoc, so now I was up to 'ZAST'.  That URL was for sale, but I didn't know the price and it was likely a few hundred dollars.

One more shift and voila: EverZast... ZAST to last forever after the Apoc.

Enjoy!
