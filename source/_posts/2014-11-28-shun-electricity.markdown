I love electricity as much as the next person who stuck two pieces of metal into the wall sockets and arced between them, blowing out the circuit,
and frying the pennies (in my case).  I have an electric phone, rode an electric motorcycle, lust for an electric car, and
am writing this on an electric computer.

Pretty sure no electricity after the Apoc.

Again, sorry about that.

So, if you have a beautiful Tesla, you better figure out how you are going to drag that sucker around town.  Or find a really
nice generator that somehow can recharge that sucker, put generator into the trunk or frunk of the Tesla, and then you
are really mobile.

Electric guitar... switch to acoustic.

Electric shaver... grow a beard (fool).

Candles... gas stove... pens... bards...

I would also say 'Shun really heavy things' like pianos.  My daughters can play the piano, but they also can play the flute
and violin.  Much more portable.  Pianos are good sources of: 'wood', 'wires', 'plastic', 'planks', 'metal', 'coffins', [come on, I know you can do it]
