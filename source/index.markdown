# Zombie Apocalypse Survival Training!

How to enable our species to last Forever... or at least a little longer... after the apocalypse...

##What if they are right?

No, I don't really think there will be a zombie apocalypse.  But I can't be sure.  And Holly Wood, Mad Hattan, and even Big Ben have been
describing all kinds of nasty futures.  What if they are right?  And I wasn't prepared?  I would feel pretty stupid then wouldn't I?

So this site is about preparing for the coming zombie apocalypse or similar event.  Read on or move along.

This site is not about going to hide out in a shelter.  After the Apoc (the start of the apocalypse... think epoc but more aweful), I would like
a real community, ideally with friends I have now and some new ones to boot.  We might be trapped in a walled city or scrounging the wastelands
for food, but we will be _together_ and _normal_.  Or at least as _normal_ as you can be after the Apoc...

As you will learn, my preparation for keeping/rebuilding my community after the Apoc is actually quite rigorous, challenging, and even fun.
To be useful post-Apoc, your community will need to have a lot of skills (some a little 'unusual'): I am working on shooting a bow from a horse,
my daughter can make a non-electric radio receiver,
and my family knows how to cook (if not kill) some game meats.  We appear to be quite normal... go to normal schools, work normal jobs,
hang out with mostly normal people.  But we also hang out with some more 'unusual' people to learn more 'unusual' but highly useful skills.

One of the first recommendations I am going to make is 'unbox' yourself.  Keep an open mind.  Try things a few times before dismissing it.
Hang with Peter Palomo at his archery range in spite of the bad reviews.  You might be surprised to find out the more 'unusual' of us
are actually both very nice and in some ways 'fricking awesome'.

Enjoy.
