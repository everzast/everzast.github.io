  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is specifically for the human male.  If you are either not-human or not-male, please move along&hellip;. <a href="http://everzast.com/blog/drive-like-jason/">http://everzast.com/blog/drive-like-jason/</a></p>

<p>OK, now that they are gone, I am going to fix you.  Somehow society has broken some of you to thinking that
some women are more physically attractive than other women.  This is a lie.  And if your brain is thinking this, it is
because you have been brain-washed and aren&rsquo;t your right self.</p>

<p>First, go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk&amp;noredirect=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk&amp;noredirect=1</a> and truly listen and watch that movie.</p>

<p>OK, now excepting the guy wandering through the video every once in a while, you can tell if you are &lsquo;broken&rsquo; if
you don&rsquo;t want to please every last one of those women.</p>

<p>OK, so how to fix you?  You can watch this movie over and over.  You can watch a lot of videos.  Watch the women in your neighborhood.
And keep asking why wouldn&rsquo;t I want to please her?</p>

<h3>Monogamy</h3>

<p>Oh, and to make it perfectly clear, you must also be completely monogamous while doing this activity.  If you aren&rsquo;t
monogamous, please fix that.  I am pretty sure your wife, love, companion, girlfriend is monogamous, so what is your
problem?  Oh?  Well then find a local news stand, buy a magazine, and learn how to get relief the good old fashioned
way.  Or there is this thing called the internet.  It can help.  But being monogamous is simply a choice.  A very simple
one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a ZAS mage.  A mage is someone that is so skilled with something that it looks like magic.  And it usually requires
about ten thousand hours to become a mage.  I became a software mage by reading and writing software for 40 years, 25 years of which
were full time, and 8 years of which were at startups.  This works out to be:</p>

<ul>
<li> 15 years at maybe 500 hours a year, or 7,500 hours</li>
<li> 17 years at maybe 2000 hours a year, or 34,000 hours</li>
<li> 8 years at maybe 4000 hours a year, or 32,000 hours</li>
</ul>


<p>So I definitely passed the 10,000 hour mark by quite a bit.  I was mostly self-taught but leveraged about 2000 great books and Smalltalk-80 to
get me to where I am today.</p>

<p>I am also a tennis mage (<a href="http://supersonicfox.com/blog/being-a-mage/">http://supersonicfox.com/blog/being-a-mage/</a>) and I leveraged a great mage plus youth playing to make it take me more like 1000 hours.  That is
unusually fast to become a mage.</p>

<p>But I became a ZAS mage even faster.  I don&rsquo;t actually recommend this path to anyone, but through it I became a mage almost instantly.
It was by surviving five perils.</p>

<p>The first four were all pretty major:</p>

<ul>
<li> I was going bankrupt</li>
<li> I got fired</li>
<li> My family got evicted without notice (owner reoccupation)</li>
<li> I gave away almost all my possessions (in case we had to move to a smaller place)</li>
</ul>


<p>after all these things happened, and we had recovered from them (new job, money in bank, new home, acceptance of having no possessions)
my family was hit with a fifth peril worse than all of the above&hellip; combined&hellip;   And I changed: I leveled-up.</p>

<p>So if you want the quick path, it is probably something like the above.  But if you are patient and can put in ten thousand
hours, that is probably the better way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, zombies are slow.  But maybe not.  And velociraptors aren&rsquo;t slow.  And some things are wicked fast but can&rsquo;t climb.</p>

<p>It takes a good bit of time to get in good shape, and without electricity or running water, I am pretty sure the YMCA
will not be a great place to hang out.  So get in shape now.  Learn to run a couple miles.  Most animals and zombies give
up during the second mile.  Learn to do a pull up.  Then twenty.  Good, now you can climb a tree.</p>

<p>And try to get rid of some of that excess fat.  Yes, I know, fat tastes good, but I don&rsquo;t think you want to literally be
a tasty morsel.</p>

<p>Oh, and pass the word along to anyone you love.  We are trying to keep our community, so the maxim &ldquo;Run faster than someone else&rdquo;
is not what you are looking for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love electricity as much as the next person who stuck two pieces of metal into the wall sockets and arced between them, blowing out the circuit,
and frying the pennies (in my case).  I have an electric phone, rode an electric motorcycle, lust for an electric car, and
am writing this on an electric computer.</p>

<p>Pretty sure no electricity after the Apoc.</p>

<p>Again, sorry about that.</p>

<p>So, if you have a beautiful Tesla, you better figure out how you are going to drag that sucker around town.  Or find a really
nice generator that somehow can recharge that sucker, put generator into the trunk or frunk of the Tesla, and then you
are really mobile.</p>

<p>Electric guitar&hellip; switch to acoustic.</p>

<p>Electric shaver&hellip; grow a beard (fool).</p>

<p>Candles&hellip; gas stove&hellip; pens&hellip; bards&hellip;</p>

<p>I would also say &lsquo;Shun really heavy things&rsquo; like pianos.  My daughters can play the piano, but they also can play the flute
and violin.  Much more portable.  Pianos are good sources of: &lsquo;wood&rsquo;, &lsquo;wires&rsquo;, &lsquo;plastic&rsquo;, &lsquo;planks&rsquo;, &lsquo;metal&rsquo;, &lsquo;coffins&rsquo;, [come on, I know you can do it]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Next, you have to be creative.  But no cannibalism.</p>

<p>If you see a hammer think: hammer, piece of wood, piece of metal, tiny crutch for a schnauzer, poorly weighted and very
dull throwing axe, [keep going, I know you have it in you]</p>

<p>If you see a neighbor&rsquo;s schnauzer think: food, paper fetcher (useless), pooper (maybe), supplier of poop for a catapult (getting somewhere), [&hellip;]</p>

<p>Yes, being creative and being insane are not particularly distinguishable.  Sorry about that.  Try it out, or move along (Zombie fodder).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Strangely the second most important skill after &ldquo;Freeing Your Mind&rdquo; will be redundancy.</p>

<p>Redundancy is the art of having a &ldquo;live&rdquo; equivalent or &ldquo;hot&rdquo; spare to basically everything.
If you have this, and one item fails (Zombie Alert Warning System: ZAWS), then the backup item (ZAW2) is <em>incredibly</em>
unlikely to fail at exactly the same time.   If ZAWS1 and ZAWS2 fail at <em>exactly</em> the same time, then you did not
have a real ZAWS at all, and we will deal with avoiding that problem later (you do know what QA is right?).</p>

<p>Redundancy is incredibly valuable in all things.  Except in marriage.  Monogamy is clearly superior.  But even then you
should have a Hot Spare readily available.  Because you never know do you?  Zombies and all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The number one skill you must have after the Apoc is to &ldquo;Free Your Mind&rdquo;.  You can not have any negative assumptions about
almost anything.  Again, please trust me.  Amazon Asian Woman!  Might be useful.  Effervescent Ebony Girls!  Might be useful.
Both are amazingly hot, and likely the sources for Apoc Gen2.  If you can&rsquo;t see that, please get your glasses, your cojones,
or whatever does the looking for your body, cleaned and lubed.  Today I hugged #1 and #2 and the ethnicity of neither
affected the hardness of my whatever.</p>

<p>Do the sames girls, but it is hard for me to understand what your hotness sees in a balding wizard like me.  Guest lectures
are quite welcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working on building up various skills, but wasn&rsquo;t really quite sure &lsquo;why?&rsquo;.  They started forming a pattern
though, and just a few days ago I came up with the title: &ldquo;Zombie Apocalypse Training (or ZAT)&rdquo; and formally used
that when I invited someone to join me for handgun training.</p>

<p>I changed that to &lsquo;ZAP&rsquo; (Preparation) because that is more fun, but ultimately I had to get a URL.  Somehow I realized
&lsquo;training&rsquo; by itself didn&rsquo;t make much sense: I am training to cause the Apoc?  No, I want my community to survive after
the Apoc, so now I was up to &lsquo;ZAST&rsquo;.  That URL was for sale, but I didn&rsquo;t know the price and it was likely a few hundred dollars.</p>

<p>One more shift and voila: EverZast&hellip; ZAST to last forever after the Apoc.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
