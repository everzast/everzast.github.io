<div class="entry-content"><p>My journey to learn the Katana continued last night.  I found a Kendo (Sword Way) class in Palo Alto, and talked with
the instructors as well as watching for a while.  I will not be taking this class because:</p>

<ul>
<li> It doesn&rsquo;t really teach Kendo</li>
<li> It doesn&rsquo;t teach effectively</li>
<li> It is at a horrible time for me</li>
</ul>


<p>What?  A Kendo class that doesn&rsquo;t teach The Way of the Sword?  How can that be?</p>

<p>Well, you need to understand a bit about the Japanese culture and history to understand why Kendo is not really Kendo.</p>

<p>The Japanese are an amazing people: they are incredibly disciplined with both body and mind.  This makes them very
powerful.  They do amazing things both individually and in groups.  The Japanese are also very <em>obedient</em>.  They
follow orders to the letter.  They obey their masters.</p>

<p>Where these traits came from, I do not know, but together they are <em>scary</em>.  If you read Artemis Fowl, read/watch Helsing,
or any number of other books and movies, you may have noticed that the most scary person in these are the guardians
of a &ldquo;master&rdquo;.  When you are guarding your master you have <em>exactly two</em> rules:</p>

<ul>
<li> I must protect my master</li>
<li> I must obey my master</li>
</ul>


<p>Two rules.  Only two.  &ldquo;I must be nice to pigeons!&rdquo;  Not a rule.  &ldquo;I must not run over babies with my Hummer!&rdquo;  Not a
rule.  When Asimov wrote the three laws of robotics, he added a third rule about self preservation, but that one is
actually redundant with the first rule as long as you are dealing with a single master.  Basically Asimov agrees with
my rules (or caused me to recognize my rules given I love Asimov&rsquo;s work).</p>

<p>In the small, scary guardians are fine.  Even Artemis tended not to abuse the world too much with his Butler.  But
when you have a highly disciplined <em>society</em> that obeys these two rules&hellip; bad things are going to happen.  Like WW2.</p>

<p>So Kendo was normal going into WW2: It was a way to learn how to wield a Katana.  I suspect the history of its development
went like this:</p>

<ul>
<li> To practice we will use our Katanas!  [Much mayhem]</li>
<li> To practice we will use an Iaito [Unsharpened Katana]!  [Much mayhem]</li>
<li> To practice we will use a Bokken [Wooden Unsharpened Sword]! [Still some mayhem]</li>
<li> To practice we will use a Shinai [Bamboo Sword]! Ah! That works and keeps people in one piece.</li>
</ul>


<p>So Kendo progressed to the Shinai as a weapon, but otherwise was exactly the same.  To wield a Katana you slice your
opponent, so to practice with a Shinai you make exactly the same motion.  That was Kendo with a Shinai.</p>

<p>Until WW2.</p>

<p>After WW2 Japan was rebuilt both physically and mentally.  I can&rsquo;t say how a group of people managed to do this to
themselves, but when they disarmed militarily, they similarly disarmed (boxed) themselves mentally too.  It is among
the more amazing cultural transformations I can imagine.  Almost like Divergent.</p>

<p>And within the box, you can no longer practice Kendo.  You can&rsquo;t practice wielding a Katana if you know you are supposed
to be disarmed.  That is dishonest to your principles.</p>

<p>But the Japanese also love traditions.  So they changed Kendo into being about &lsquo;tapping&rsquo;.  You could call it &lsquo;hitting&rsquo;,
but it really isn&rsquo;t.  And in either case, it <em>has nothing</em> to do with wielding a Katana.  It would actually mess you
up.</p>

<p>So very interesting.  Kendo isn&rsquo;t Kendo.</p>

<p>There was a period where pre-WW2 Kendo people were still around, and still did Kendo the right way.  They were called &lsquo;Heavy Hitters&rsquo;,
but that is a misnomer.  They were slicing you with a Shinai, not hitting you at all.  That is the way of the sword.
Still looking for one of them to teach me&hellip;</p>
